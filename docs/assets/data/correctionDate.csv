These results have been extrapolated to assess the potential energy savings which could be expected at the EU level by implementing the solutions proposed by the projects. By the implementation of the different ICT solutions, buildings have achieved more than 20% energy savings.

As ambiguous information about the events becomes available, decision-makers are often tempted to quickly develop a particular story to explain the observed events. As the accident evolves, decision-makers can fail to revise their initial assessments despite contradicting information. Our approach is to reduce fixation errors and confirmation bias by providing critical thinking support. In a laboratory experiment with 60 participants, we compared the effect on decision making of a critical thinking tool, which requires the explication of evidence-conclusion relations in situation assessment, with two control conditions. Participants acted as crisis managers determining the likely cause of accidents. The results show a positive impact of the tool on both the decision-making process and decision making effectiveness.

  a central role, there is a gap between expert users who can ask
  complex questions through formal query languages (e.g., SQL), and
  lay users who either are dependent on expert users, or must restrict
  themselves to ask simpler questions (e.g., keyword search).  Because
  of the formal nature of those languages, there seems to be an
  unescapable trade-off between expressivity and usability in
  information systems. The objective of this thesis is to present a
  number of results and perspectives that show that the expressivity
  of formal languages can be reconciled with the usability of
  widespread information systems (e.g., browsing, Faceted Search
  (FS)). The final aim of this work is to empower people with the
  capability to produce, explore, and analyze their data in a powerful
  way.

  We have proposed a number of theories and implementations to better
  reconcile expressivity and usability, and applied them to a number
  of contexts going from file systems to the Semantic Web. In this
  thesis, we introduce an unifying framework inspired by Formal
  Concept Analysis (FCA) to factor out the main ideas of all those
  results: Abstract Conceptual Navigation (ACN). The principle of ACN
  is to guide users by letting them navigate in a conceptual
  space where places are concepts connected by navigation
  links. Concepts are characterized by a formal query, and are made of
  two parts: an extension and an intension. The extension
  is made of query results while the intension is made of the query
  itself and an index of query increments over results. Finally,
  navigation links are formally defined as query transformations. The
  conceptual space is not static but is induced by concrete data, and
  evolves with it. ACN therefore combines the expressivity of
  formal query languages with the guidance of conceptual
  navigation. The readability of queries is improved by
  verbalizing them to (or parsing them from) a Controlled Natural
  Language (CNL). Readability and guidance together support usability
  by speaking user's language, and by providing a systematic
  assistance.",,,,VWXSH82K,2017-02-12T06:40:00+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://hal.inria.fr/tel-01100292,,,,,,,,,"86976 | 86980 | 86984 | 86988",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,61017,,,,,,,,,"244 | 344",,,,,,,,,,,

Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and many others are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing information from Twitter, Google, Verizon, 23andMe, Facebook, Wikipedia, and every space where large groups of people leave digital traces and deposit data. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale analysis of DNA help cure diseases? Or will it usher in a new wave of medical inequality? Will data analytics help make people’s access to information more efficient and effective? Or will it be used to track protesters in the streets of major cities? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‘research’ means? Some or all of the above?This essay offers six provocations that we hope can spark conversations about the issues of Big Data.
